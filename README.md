## SQL PROJECT: Oline Clothing Store

The `P9-OLTP.csv` file contains data extracted from an OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) system. This table is designed to store transactional data and is structured to support efficient querying and data manipulation.

## Table Structure

The table includes the following columns:

- **TransactionID**: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- **CustomerID**: A unique identifier for each customer involved in the transaction.
- **ProductID**: A unique identifier for each product involved in the transaction.
- **Quantity**: The number of units of the product involved in the transaction.
- **TransactionDate**: The date and time when the transaction occurred.
- **Price**: The price of the product at the time of the transaction.
- **TotalAmount**: The total amount for the transaction, calculated as Quantity * Price.

## Usage

This table can be used for various analytical purposes, such as:

- Tracking sales and transaction trends over time.
- Analyzing customer purchasing behavior.
- Monitoring product performance and inventory levels.
- Generating financial reports and insights.

## Example Query

Here is an example SQL query to retrieve the total sales amount for each product:

```sql
SELECT ProductID, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM P9-OLTP
GROUP BY ProductID;
```

This query sums up the total sales amount for each product, providing insights into the performance of different products.

## Notes

- Ensure that the data is regularly updated to reflect the latest transactions.
- Proper indexing on columns like `TransactionID`, `CustomerID`, and `ProductID` can improve query performance.
- Handle any missing or inconsistent data appropriately to maintain data integrity.
